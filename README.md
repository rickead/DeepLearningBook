# Deep Learning Book Examples for TensorFlow 2.3
This repository contains a set of examples from the Deep Learning book, written by Jash Patterson & Adam Gibson. The examples in the book were written for DL4J (https://deeplearning4j.org/) and I have translated these examples into TensorFlow 2.3 with Keras.

The final version of each example is in this top-level directory, with scripts that are not ready for publication in the 'future' directory.
